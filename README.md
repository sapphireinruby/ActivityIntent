# Activity Intent<br/>
Android Explicit Intent between activities and date transfer<br/>
This repository is a practice and note for myself of Android Explicit Intent<br/>
with activities between views and date transfer sample <br/><br/>

Fixed Git commit warmming: fatal: CRLF would be replaced by LF in gradlew.bat. during executing git<br/>
by executed command: git config –global core.autocrlf false<br/><br/>
Fixed Android Studio upload error: Can't connect to repository from configured remote. You could want to check .git config...<br/>
by reset the config setting on local file
